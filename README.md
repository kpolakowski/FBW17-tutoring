## How to work with this repository?

1. Clone it first with:

```
git clone git@github.com:kpolakowski/fbw17-tutoring.git
```

2. Create your own branch and switch to it with:

```
git checkout -b YOUR_BRANCH_NAME
```

3. You can start doing exercises, after you finish doing them execute these commands:

```
git add .
git commit -m “DESCRIPTION OF A COMMIT”
```

4. After I push new tasks, you can pull everything from remote **_origin_** with:

```
git pull origin
```

5. After that you can merge **YOUR BRANCH NAME** with your local master branch by writing:

```
git merge master
```

Answers to the tasks are in branch **_solutions_**.

## Important things

- always check in which branch you are before committing anything
- do the exercises **only** in YOUR branch, **not in master**
- do not commit anything to your local master branch, if you do it you won’t be able to pull from the origin remote; you can undo it by writing

```
git reset --hard HEAD~
```
